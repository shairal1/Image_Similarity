# Image Similarity Project: Van Gogh Artworks

This project explores image similarity using images scraped from Google of the renowned artist Vincent Van Gogh. The goal is to analyze and visualize the similarities between different Van Gogh artworks.

## Overview

- Scraped Van Gogh images from Google.
- Calculated image embeddings for each artwork.
- Implemented a slider in the notebook for dynamically exploring image similarities.
- Used cosine similarity metric to measure the similarity between image embeddings.
- Visualized pairs of images and their cosine similarity scores.

## How to Use

-Navigate to the end of the notebook where you'll find a slider as shown below .

- Adjust the slider to compare the similarities between different Van Gogh artworks.

## File Structure

- **`image_similarity_notebook.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook containing the main analysis and visualization.
- **`urls.txt`**: contains urls of the images.


## Here are some image similarities predicted by the Model
